    WORDLIST EMOJI STANDARD — v1.0
```

## ✨ Vision

**BIPEmojiSeed** is the official **Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)** for a global special to emojiset standard:

---

## 🌐 Overview

A complete, open standard for mapping the ** wordlist (2048 words)** into **2048 unique emoji pairs**.

flame → 🔥💨

BIPEmojiSeed bridges **mnemonic seed phrases** with **visual memory cues**, making them more intuitive while keeping **1-to-1 uniqueness** and **cryptographic integrity**.

**Why is this needed?**

There are several reasons why this is needed:
- It is a fun, creative  way to remember access words
- It secures seedlists with an emoji-based mnemonic cypher
- It reduces human error in handling mnemonics
- Builds cross-lingual, cross-cultural, multi-functional memorability
- Creates a foundation for libraries, **mneumonic devices**, **wallet UIs**, **educational tools**, and **next-gen apps**

## 🤔 What is this really?

**BIPEmojiSeed** is a **Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP)** for a standard that defines a mapping between the 2048 words of the official wordlist and 2048 unique [BIP emojiseed set](https://emojiseed.com/blob/90768f83a6d5503588623e012ede9118ef60dca6/emojiset.txt).

**EmojiSet** 
- https://emojiseed.com/blob/90768f83a6d5503588623e012ede9118ef60dca6/emojiset.txt

The project’s goal is to provide a **universal, language-agnostic, and user-friendly mnemonic system** that complements existing special wordlists while improving **cross-cultural accessibility** and **human memorability**.

# BIPEmojiSeed — Emoji Pairs for BIP-39 (v1)

A deterministic, one-to-one mapping of the 2,048 BIP-39 English words to 2,048 unique **emoji pairs**. Express mnemonic phrases visually while remaining fully backward-compatible with existing BIP-39 tooling and wallets.

- **Complete coverage**: 2048 → 2048, no gaps
- **Uniqueness**: no two words share the same emoji pair
- **Cross-platform safe**: Unicode NFC; no variation selectors
- **Human-centric**: memorable visuals for concrete and abstract terms
- **Open source**: MIT License

## Status

- ✅ Initial mapping completed and normalized
- ✅ Validator scripts and tests
- 📨 BIP draft under community review
- 🔧 Seeking feedback on clarifier pools and abstract word mappings

## Why Emoji Mnemonics?

Emoji provide language-agnostic, highly memorable cues. By standardizing an emoji-pair mapping for each BIP-39 word, wallets and tools can render the same seed in a consistent visual form without altering underlying entropy or compatibility.

## Data & Artifacts

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `extras/word-emoji-mapping.csv` | Canonical mapping: index, word, emoji1, emoji2 |
| `data/emoji.txt` | One emoji pair per line for simple scripting |
| `data/mapping.json` | Machine-readable spec with code points and categories |
| `docs/spec.md` | Normative specification of rules and invariants |
| `tests/golden/*.snap` | Golden snapshots used by validators |

Release artifacts include SHA256 checksums and signatures.

## Algorithm (Normative Summary)

The mapping is generated by rules that maximize clarity and stability:

1. **Direct match**  
   If a word has a universal emoji, duplicate it:  
   `dog → 🐶🐶`, `book → 📖📖`.

2. **Calendar/temporal terms**  
   Months and weekdays use season/time/celebration anchors:  
   `october → 🎃🎃`, `friday → 📅📅`.

3. **Numbers and magnitudes**  
   Use keycaps and numeric symbols as appropriate:  
   `one → 1️⃣1️⃣`, `ten → 🔟🔟`, `hundred → 💯💯`.

4. **Actions vs objects (primary + clarifier)**  
   - Nouns: `object + clarifier` → `lock → 🔒🧩`  
   - Verbs/participles: `action + clarifier` → `run → 🏃‍♂️⚡`

5. **Clarifier pools**  
   Second emoji is chosen from stable pools to disambiguate:  
   - Action: ⚙️ ✍️ ✅  
   - Object: 🧩 📎  
   - Time: ⏰ 📅  
   - Nature/Place: 🌿 🧭

6. **Global uniqueness**  
   A collision triggers rotation of clarifier, then primary. As a last resort only, fall back to `✅` as universal clarifier. The final table must contain **2,048 unique pairs**.

7. **Unicode stability**  
   - Normalize to NFC  
   - Forbid variation selectors (e.g., VS-16)  
   - Follow Unicode TR-51 emoji grapheme guidance

These rules are implemented in the generator and enforced by validators.

## CLI & Scripts

```bash
# Install
npm ci

# Validate everything (uniqueness, NFC, graphemes, roundtrip)
npm run validate:all

# Regenerate artifacts from source rules/pools
npm run build

# Print stats (duplicates, codepoints, widths)
npm run stats

# Round-trip test: word -> emoji -> word
npm run test:roundtrip
```


## 🚀 Features

- **Complete Coverage**  
  Every word maps to exactly two emoji code points (2048 → 2048).
  
- **Uniqueness**  
  No two words share the same emoji pair, ensuring unambiguous decoding.

- **Cross-Platform Safe**  
  Variation selectors removed; all emoji pairs normalized to Unicode NFC.

- **Human-Friendly**  
  Tight semantic ties: concrete nouns → objects, actions → action + clarifier, numbers/dates → calendar/number emojis.

- **Open Source**  
  Released under MIT license.

## EmojiSeed 🌱✨

The **Emoji wordlist** is a deterministic mapping of the 2048 special words into **2048 unique emoji pairs**. This allows mnemonic phrases to be displayed and remembered visually, across languages and literacy barriers.


📜 Examples

```
snake → 🐍🐍
flame → 🔥💨
alarm → ⏰❗
book  → 📖📖

```
```
Mnemonic phrases like: gravity, tiger, flame, alarm, book
map to: 🌌🌌, 🐯🐯, 🔥💨 , ⏰❗, 📖📖

```
