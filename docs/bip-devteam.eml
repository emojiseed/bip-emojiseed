Subject: [BIP Draft] Emoji Seed Mnemonics for Deterministic Keys
Body:
Hello all, Iâ€™d like to propose a new informational BIP: Emoji Seed Mnemonics for Deterministic Keys.

This addition specifies a deterministic mapping between the BIP-39 English wordlist (2048 words) and 2048 unique emojiset pairs.

Motivation:
Improves memorability and cross-lingual usability.
Provides a language-independent, visual mnemonic format.
Provides a standard data reference to make next-gen apps and seed masking devices.
Backwards-compatible: emoji mnemonics map directly to the existing BIP-39 English wordlist.

Scope:
Does not affect BIP-39 wordlist definitions.
No changes to entropy, checksum, or seed derivation.
Adds an optional, standard emoji mapping layer for new applications.

Emojiset algorithm logic available at: https://emojiseed.com/

Feedback is most welcome! :)

Mahalo,
Hakim
