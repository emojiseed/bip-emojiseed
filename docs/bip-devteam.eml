Hello team, I would like to present for discussion a new informational BIP: Emoji Seed
Mnemonics for Deterministic Keys.

This smart addition specifies a deterministic mapping reference between BIP-39 English
words (2048 words) and unique emoji sets (2048 sets).

Motivation:
Improves memorability and cross-lingual usability.
Provides a language-independent, visual mnemonic format.
Provides a standard library reference for apps and reminder devices.
Backwards-compatible: emoji mnemonics map directly to the existing BIP-39 English wordlist.

Scope:
Does not change the BIP-39 wordlist.
No changes to entropy, checksum, or seed derivation.
Adds an optional, standard emoji mapping layer for new applications.

Full text, logic, algorithm and reference files are available here:

Feedback is welcome and cherished! :)

Mahalo,
Hakim
